## Git ignoring assignment 
to create a .gitignore file, in the command line: 
```
touch .gitignore
```
then you'll get a .gitignore file in your projects section. 
### steps 
file content of the .gitignore 'as specified':
```
/packages
secret.js
*.txt
log*

```
then we repeat the same steps , if we did it the correct way, we should have only the files we needed on the github repository:

My files :

vs the uploaded files :

And we are done!
