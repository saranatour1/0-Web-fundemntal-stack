## Remote Repository Assignment

In this assignment, I created some files, and since I already have a repository for this section, I didn't create a new one from scratch. Here are the steps I took:

### Steps

1. I created a few files in this folder.
2. Next, I added all the files using the following command in my terminal:
```
git add .
```

3. Then, I committed these files to GitHub using the command:

```
git commit -m "Committed staged files to GitHub"
```

4. Finally, I pushed these files using the command:

```
git push
```
5. And if you do that correctly You can see a picture of baby Yoda at the end !
